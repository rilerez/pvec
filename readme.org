* what: This library aims to provide
- functional data structures for C++
- pluggable memory management schemes for them
- currently experimental / pre alpha / drawing board
* why
** why functional programming?
- less state
- explicit state
- easier to reason about
- concurrency
  - shared immutable memory = no lock
** why functional data structures?
Pure functional programming does not allow values to change. Instead of modifying a data structure in place (destructive updates), a functional program must produce updated copies (non--destructive updates). Because of this constraint, functional data structures must make copy-with-modification cheap. This is achieved by sharing internal structure among copies; updates create a shallow copy, changing only what is necessary to incorporate the new data.

- even outside of functional programming you need to keep old values
  - undo
- value semantics for node-based containers
** why make the memory management pluggable/separate
*** all functional data structures need to share internal data
**** you cannot copy everything every time you want to update
**** update = new head/bookkeeping, but point to as much "old" internal data as possible. only update the part that changed
***** like copy on write but much less copying
*** lifetime of internals of data structures is determined at run time
*** ==> deterministic destruction won't work
*** memory management schemes + garbage collectors is complex. this complexity must not leak into the data structures themselves. but we still need a way to tweak the choices.
*** most fp languages use a garbage collector
**** C++ doesn't have a built-in garbage collector because picking a global garbage collecting scheme is not appropriate in many situations
**** no one size fits all
*** the organization of the data structure is conceptually separate from the mechanism you choose to manage memory
**** shared_ptr vs something else?
*** why not use shared_ptr?
**** reference counting is not always optimal/appropriate
***** functional programming and functional datastructures need to make tons of shallow copies.
***** needing to perform atomic operations on every update (hence every shallow copy) is not always an acceptable bottleneck
***** an unfortunate chain of destructors can still blow the stack with reference counting
***** the mechanism shared_ptr uses to allocate may not be appropriate, so allocation needs to be decoupled anyway
**** tracing garbage collectors can allocate fast
***** atomically bumping a pointer
****** distributing parts of the heap to individual threads can eliminate the need for synchronization/atomicity
**** compacting garbage collectors can improve cace locality of data
**** different gc schemes require different trade-offs
***** throughput vs latency
**** is a stop-the-world collection acceptable?
**** data used for intermediate calculations can be fully discarded => no need for any memory management
**** sometimes tagged pointers > variant of shared pointers
***** more compact => better locality
*** why not just use allocators?
**** allocators are useful here
**** but there is more that needs to be done
**** memory access patterns are different from non-functional code
**** need to interface at a higher level (type-aware) than allocators
***** option to organize allocations by type
****** instead of saving a byte for a variant, can check address
***** the data structures will specifically ask for nodes
